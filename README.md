A repository for notes on Agile Chartering and templates to use.


## Overview Section

This is an introduction to Agile Chartering from my experience and from what I’ve learned from fellow practitioners. If you find this helpful, please use it. 

Agile chartering is a powerful tool, and when used regularly (in my experience, quarterly or every 12 weeks), a team can realize even more benefits with practice and trust.

An agile chartering session is the opportunity to create a common understanding of the goals for a project through conversation together (real-time in person or by video meeting). Co-creating the charter gives the team one of the best chances of accomplishing their goals. In the session, the team works out any details, agree on success criteria, and make roles clear. After the session, the charter artifact also serves as a guide in the work as a reference during the period the charter covers (I usually recommend 12 weeks).

### Purpose of a charter session

The three critical elements of a project chartering session are purpose, alignment, and context.

*“In the spirit of the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto, chartering takes on a new meaning. Agile chartering is a lightweight, minimum-documentation approach to creating initial understandings, agreements, and alignment about the work and how it will be accomplished. Agile chartering catalyzes the interactions needed to accomplish the work, facilitates a quick start on delivering softwares, accelerates collaboration within a the team and across the project community, and sets the context for re-planning when new information becomes available.”* - Diana Larsen & Ainsley Nies, Liftoff

### The facilitator

One of the most important aspects of an Agile Chartering session is that everyone on the team is able to participate fully as a member of the conversation. Having a neutral facilitator is key. Someone that is not connected strongly to the work, and can remain objective. In their role, they do not share their opinion or perspective, but focus on guiding the conversation, keeping the group on track, and, if in person, facilitating at the white board writing down what was said and agreed upon.

### Agenda for the chartering session

1. Welcome and introductions (and brief icebreaker)
2. Review the agenda
3. Co-author the charter
    1. What is the purpose of the work?

    3. What are the goals and outcomes?
    4. Determine the time length
    5. What is the success criteria?
    6. What are the assumptions and dependencies?
